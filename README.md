# Summation-Calculator-Program
This Python program reads an integer from the user and calculates the summation from 1 to the entered number. The program prompts the user to input the integer, uses a loop to add all numbers from 1 up to the entered number, and displays the calculated summation. It handles any integer number entered.
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p>
The code reads an integer number from the user using the input() function, which prompts the user to enter a number. The int() function is used to convert the user's input to an integer, and the resulting integer is stored in the variable num.

The variable sum is then initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the summation of numbers from 1 to num.

A for loop is used to iterate over a range of numbers starting from 1 up to num+1, where num+1 is used because the range function generates a sequence of numbers that excludes the last number specified. In each iteration of the loop, the current number (i) is added to the sum.

Finally, the calculated summation is printed to the console using the print() function, which displays a message containing the entered number and its corresponding summation.

Overall, this code allows the user to input an integer number and calculates the summation of all numbers from 1 up to that number.
